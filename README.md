> Upon the Mind and Heart, a Verse
Lo! 'Tis the mind, the nimble sprites of thought,
Whose little cells do solve what sense cannot.
The morrow, dressed in robes of ancient grace,
Doth speak with tongues from times we scarce embrace.
Fear not, for naught be wrought but to be known;
The truth, once found, shall sit on reason’s throne.
And liberty, that tempest wild and true,
Is forged from deeds that time and fate did strew.
<br>
— with humble bows to Agatha Christie, Carlo Levi, Marie Curie and Jean-Paul Sartre
